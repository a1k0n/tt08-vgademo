# a1k0n's tinytapeout08 demo compo entry

![preview](preview.png)

## How it works

It's a standalone VGA+sound demo that fits in two tiles; you'll just have to
see.

This was developed with a 48MHz clock, so it's in a funky VGA video mode -- it's
standard 640x480@60Hz VGA timing and 4:3 aspect ratio, but with 1220 horizontal
pixels instead of 640.  All graphics are dithered down to RGB222 with a Bayer
matrix which alternates each frame. Because of the dithering and the weird
resolution, it looks best on a real CRT, but any VGA monitor ought to work.

Sound is generated using a 16-bit sigma-delta DAC on io7 from an internal
3-channel synth (triangle, noise, and square waves).

I will add more info here after the deadline passes, as the demo is in flux as I
try to fit effects into 2 tiles...

## How to test

Run clock at 48MHz, connect VGA and sound Pmods, and give it a reset pulse.

## External hardware

Follows the [democompo hardware rules](https://tinytapeout.com/competitions/demoscene/#what-are-the-rules):

[TinyVGA Pmod](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga) for video on o[7:0].

1-bit sound on io[7], compatible with [Tiny Tapeout Audio
Pmod](https://github.com/MichaelBell/tt-audio-pmod), or any basic ~20kHz RC filter
on io7 to an amplifier will work.
